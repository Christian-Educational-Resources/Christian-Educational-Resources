        <p>Christian Educational Resources (CER) was founded in 2023 to offer resources to Christian
          parents, professional educators, and students at all levels who desire to pursue private 
          Christian education but struggle financially to do so. CER is a non-profit organization and 
          the resources offered through CER are free to all. The organization is set up to 
          operate through the biblical principal of voluntary giving rather than through 
          charging fees for products and services. <br>
          CER is operated and governed by a chief and his council consisting of from 
          five to ten advisory council members. The chief and and council members must be
          professing Christians with clear evidence of sacrificial Christ-like service. This
          stipulation is not intended to speak animosity toward unbelievers but to foster 
          biblical unity among believers within the organization. We are commanded in
          <strong>2nd Corintians 6:14 "Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what 
          fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light 
          with darkness?</strong>"
