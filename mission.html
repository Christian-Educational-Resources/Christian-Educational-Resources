        <p>The mission of CER is simply to provide Christian educational resources for free. <br>
          Too often, a quality Christian education is unavailable to believers who are 
          at the lower end of the economic spectrum. In some cases, certain Christian
          educational resources have not been produced because such resources may be 
          considered "high risk" for "low profit" by business establishments. Any believer who has
          searched for quality college-level Christian liberal arts textbooks is painfully aware of 
          this unfortunate reality. When Christian educational resources have indeed been produced,
          the price is often set at a level which only high-middle to upperclass families can 
          afford. To offset this, CER aspires to provide as many free resources as possible in order
          to put a quality private Christian education within reach of all believers. Christians
          are challenged by <strong>Galations 6:2 "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the 
          law of Christ."</strong>
